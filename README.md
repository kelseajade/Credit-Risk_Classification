# Credit-Risk_Classification
 
Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to develop a machine learning model capable of prediction loan risks of individuals in a peer to peer lending company. The model classified loans as a healthy low-risk loan or a high-risk loan. The dataset contained details about the loan. The model predicted 18,765 instances of healthy loans and 619 high-risk instances. The data was split into testing sets and training sets. The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were also used to understand the distribution of predictions. 

Results
* Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression 
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision and Recall Scores:
Healthy Loans (0):
Precision: 1.00
Recall: 0.99
F1-Score: 1.00
High-Risk Loans (1):
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.95
F1-Score: 0.89
* Machine Learning Model 2: 

Summary
The best performing model was logistic regression as it had the highest overal accuraccy and had close precision and recall for both high-risk and healthy loans.
